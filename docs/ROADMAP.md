# NanoTrace Roadmap

## Vision
NanoTrace provides **blockchain-backed certification** for nanotechnology products, ensuring trust, transparency, and safety across global supply chains.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Core Setup (‚úÖ Completed)
- Provision Ubuntu VPS with Python 3.12, PostgreSQL 16, Redis, Docker, Go, Node.js, NGINX.
- Scaffold project structure:
  - Flask backend skeleton
  - Fabric minimal network (peer + CA)
- Initialize PostgreSQL schema and DB migrations.
- Basic health checks (`/healthz` endpoint).

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Authentication & Admin Control (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Implement user registration (email + password).
- Add admin login panel.
- Email verification flow.
- Protect `/admin` routes.
- Bootstrap initial admin account.

---

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Certification Workflow
- Certificate application form (product details, MSDS link, supplier).
- Admin review + approval dashboard.
- On approval:
  - Generate unique cert ID.
  - Mint certificate entry on Fabric ledger.
  - Generate QR code linked to verification page.
- User dashboard to view applied/approved certificates.

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Blockchain Integration
- Generate MSP crypto material + genesis block.
- Launch orderer + full Fabric network.
- Write and deploy chaincode for certificate issuance and verification.
- Integrate Flask backend ‚Üí Fabric peer ‚Üí chaincode calls.
- Add Fabric transaction logging in DB.

---

## Phase 5 ‚Äî Frontend & UX
- Build clean UI for registration, login, dashboard.
- Certificate verification page (scan QR ‚Üí verify on chain).
- Admin dashboard with approval queue.
- Styling aligned with NanoTrace branding.

---

## Phase 6 ‚Äî Production Deployment
- Deploy Flask app with Gunicorn + systemd.
- Reverse proxy via NGINX (TLS enabled with Let‚Äôs Encrypt).
- Enable backups (PostgreSQL, Fabric crypto).
- Harden security (fail2ban, ufw, TLS-only).
- Load testing and scaling checks.

---

## Phase 7 ‚Äî Business Expansion
- Engage with nanotech manufacturers and regulators.
- Offer paid certification issuance.
- Provide blockchain audit tools for customs and logistics.
- Explore EU/ISO compliance alignment.
- Develop API endpoints for partner integrations.

---

üìå **Summary**
NanoTrace is progressing from **environment setup ‚Üí auth & admin ‚Üí certification workflow ‚Üí blockchain integration ‚Üí production deployment**. Each phase builds toward a commercial-grade certification platform for nanotechnology products.
